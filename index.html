        <!--
        <p class="text1-2">In traveling over a compara &mdash;<br>
          tively level county, with a good road and light loads on the sleds, the<br>
          dogs will maintain a trot, which is faster than a man can walk, but<br>
          not as fast as he can run, so the trail maker runs ahead for soine dis&mdash;<br>
          tance and then slows down to a walk until the head team comes up<br>
          with him, when he repeats the operation.</p>
-->

        <!--
        <p>But this was not to be accomplished as usually pictured, sitting back on the sled and cracking a whip. 
          
          In Alaska, at least, it is not that way, and
          unless the road is very smooth and the load light, 
          
          the men of an outfit must not only walk, but push, and haul, and sometimes harness
          themselves up to the sleds to get along. 
          
          At first such work seems
          killing, but you get used to it like anything else and take it as a
          matter of course.</p>
-->



        <!--
        <p>All our travel heretofore had been by dog teams, and, as we were
          to have much deer traveling farther on, I was very anxious to try the
          change and note the difference, wishing for anything that would hurry
          us along.</p>
-->

        <!--
        <p>All hands must be
          ready at the same time when starting a deer train, for, just as soon as
          the animals see the head team start, they are all off with a jump, and
          for a short time keep up a very high rate of speed. 
          
          If one is not
          quick in jumping and holding on to his sled, he is likely either to lose
          his team or be dragged along in the snow. 
          
          They soon come down to
          a moderate gait, however, and finally drop into a walk when tired.</p>
-->

        <!--
        <p>No whip is used, and none
          should be, for the deer are very timid and easily frightened, and
          once gotten in that state they are hard to quiet and control.</p>
-->

        <!--
        <p>my deer, 
         
         which, as I afterwards
          learned, once had a leg broken by the sled running ahead on him,
          
          became frightened and bolted down the hill, throwing me off the
          sled. I held on to the line and was dragged through the snow against
          an old fish rack at the bottom of the hill. 
          
          When I saw that fish rack
          loom up, I thought my time had come, but my bones seemed stronger
          than the rack, for throwing my head aside, my shoulder caught the
          upright and broke it short off. 
          
          When I finally stopped the deer and
          pulled myself together, I was grateful to find I had no bones broken,
          for such a thing was too serious a matter even for contemplation.</p>
-->

        <!--
        <p>It seemed to be
          my day for accidents, for soon after dark my deer wandered from the
          trail, became entangled in a lot of driftwood on the beach, half covered
          with snow, and finally wound up by running the sled full speed against
          a stump, breaking the harness, dragging the line out of my hand, and
          
          disappearing in the darkness and flying snow.</p>
-->

        <!--
        <p>It was very cold sitting idly on a deer sled, 
         
         and it was all we could do to keep some part of the body from freezing;
          many times a sharp twinge or prick would make one’s head turn from
          the wind and his hand go up, to work vigorously to rouse the feeble
          circulation in the end of his nose.</p>

        <p>The most interesting graveyard in Alaska is at Point Hope. It is
          situated about a mile from the village, on slightly elevated ridges of
          sand and gravel covering the undulations of an extinct glacier. Most of
          the bodies are raised four to six feet from the ground and supported
          with structuresmade preferably of the jaws and ribs of the wiiale, while
          others are constructed of driftwood. Should a death occur in winter,
          when the snow lies on the ground hard and deep, the bodies are laid
          out on the surface until the summer, when the snow disappears and
          enables the relatives to find material to build one of their scaffolds, on
          which the body is then placed</p>

        </div>

        <p id="text5-1">Though it turned out to be a horrible place, no palace could<br>
          have been more welcome. It was a small hut, about 10 by 12, and 5<br>
          feet high, and 15 people were already sleeping there. It was most<br>
          filthy and the worst house I have seen in all my Alaskan experience;<br>
          but I was too tired then to care for that, too tired even to eat; and<br>
          though I had had nothing but a couple of crackers since morning, I<br>
          was quite satisfied to take off my wet clothing, crawl into my bag,<br>
          and sleep.</p>

        <p id="text5-2">The small huts, called “igloos,” <br>
          are occupied by one or more families, often<br>
          being very crowded. The large hut was the “kazheem,” used for<br>
          the dance house, council house, general workhouse, and place of<br>
          lodging for travelers; and is occupied by all the male inhabitants of<br>
          the village who have no families</p>

        <!--          THIRST-->

        <p class="text1-2">It is always well before starting in the morning to take as much tea<br>
          and water as one can hold, to avoid as much as possible a thirst during<br>
          the day. It is impossible to get water during the day without<br>
          stopping to build a fire and melt snow, unless one carries a flask<br>
          inside the clothing, and this stopping uses up time. Snow is bad<br>
          for the mouth and soon makes it sore, besides not being sufficient<br>
          to quench the thirst except for the minute. The worst feature of eating<br>
          snow is that if one gives way to the temptation there is no stop&mdash;<br>
          ping for the rest of the day, for, while it serves to quench the thirst<br>
          for the time being, it seems to really increase it in the long run, and<br>
          shortly after taking some snow one is more thirsty than ever. I<br>
          found that by drinking a quart of tea in the morning I seldom was<br>
          thirsty until night, and had no great desire to drink unless a halt was<br>
          made in the middle of the day to rest and make a fire for tea.</p>

        <!--       MIDDAY HALT-->

        <p id="text6-3">If in the middle ot the dav wood
          could be had, and other circumstances would permit, a stop was made
          to make a fire, melt snow, and have a lunch of tea and ciackeis.
          Sometimes, however, circumstances would not permit us to stop, and
          we kept on the entire day without a break. At first I was more loath
          to stop than later, but after more experience I found that the hour
          spent in getting our fire and a bite to eat was well spent, for not only
          were we refreshed and better able to continue in the afternoon, but
          the dogs also seemed to be benefited by the short rest and traveled
          all the better for it.</p>

        <!--        DIFFICULTIES-->

        <p>I thought the ice we recently passed over had made a rough road,
          but this was even worse, for here were all the crushings of the straits
          shoved up against the mountains that ran down abruptly into the sea,
          and over this kind of ice we had to make our way. Darkness set
          in long before we had come to the worst of it, and a faint moon gave
          too little light for such a road. It was a continuous jumble of dogs,
          sleds, men, and ice—particularly ice—and it would be hard to tell
          which suffered most, men or dogs. Once, in helping the sled over a
          particularly bad place, I was thrown 8 or 9 feet down a slide, landing
          on the back of my head with the sled on top of me.</p>

        <p>it was too cold to camp without wood, and, as the ice
          we were on was in danger of breaking off from the shore any minute,
          it was necessary that we get beyond the line of bluffs before stop¬
          ping. In the darkness I stepped through a crack in the ice, and my
          leg to the knee was immediately one mass of ice. I was now com¬
          pelled to go on to some place where my foot gear could be dried, and,
          though almost ready to drop where I was,

          I had to keep on, for to
          stop, meant to freeze.</p>

        <p>we found the ice of sufficient thickness to
          cross with the sleds.</p>

        <p>as the ice was hard and level, made excellent
          progress,</p>

        <p>Crossing the bay

          the next day the ice was firm and smooth
          and good progress was made until nearing the north shore, where
          rough ice and deep snow began.

          The wind had not only crushed up
          the ice, but had driven the snow all over to that side of the bay, and
          it was a hard struggle through it to the shore.</p>

        <p>ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice cie ie ii c</p>

        <p>By this
          time some of our dogs were in rather bad shape.

          The thin crust on
          the snow coming across the delta country and the hard ice on the
          river had lacerated the cushions of their feet, and

          many of them left
          a trail of blood behind them with every step.</p>

        <p>Besides this, the two
          natives who had accompanied us thus far had

          developed heavy colds</p>

        <p> 0° -5° -10° -15° -20° -25° -30 -35° -40°</p>

        <p>The difference between care and carelessness is slight,

          in arctic travel, and the first let-up is sure to bring its

          reminder in the shape of a frosted toe or finger or a frozen nose. One must be on guard, and the
          slightest tinge in the nose or cheek must be heeded, and circulation
          started again by vigorous rubbing. Though somewhat disagreeable
          and painful, freezing these parts is not necessarily harmful unless too
          long neglected.

          I saw a case where the end of a man’s nose had
          dropped off from frostbite, but such things are rare. Usually the
          skin is discolored, becomes dead and peels off, leaving the member
          quite sensitive for a time.

          But with the hands, and especially the
          feet, it is different. No part of the body requires more attention
          than these ; socks and boots must be well made and kept thoroughly
          dry; even the slightest perspiration will, if one stops too long, work dis¬
          astrously. Both boots and socks should be changed immediately upon
          going into camp, and dry ones must be put on in the morning before
          starting. The natives know the importance of this only too well, and
          if they see one inclined to neglect these precautions, they will insist
          on his taking care of his foot gear.

          It is the easiest thing in the world
          for a man to suffer severely in such a climate, but it is possible, by
          good care and attention, to avoid what one might call extreme suffering, and live there with only the unavoidable discomforts of the country,
          to which a man in good health sooner or later grows accustomed.</p>

        <p class="text1-2">The favorite way among the Eskimos of camping in this part of the<br>
          country is to build snow houses at night. The wind packs the snow<br>
          so hard that with a long knife it can be cut into blocks like building<br>
          stone, and in a short time a small strong house can be constructed<br>
          with these, the chinks being stopped up with loose snow, and a large<br>
          block used as a door to close theopening, making the place nearly air&mdash;<br>
          tight. Soon the warmth of the bodies of three or four people, together<br>
          with the heat from a native seal-oil lamp or kerosene-oil stove, will<br>
          raise the temperature of the place so that it is fairly comfortable, and<br>
          one can even remove some of his clothing. On account of the diffi&mdash;<br>
          culties of construction, a snow house can not be so large as a tent, and<br>
          the oil for the stove adds greatly to the weight to be carried; but, when<br>
          traveling back from the coast, where there is no wood, snow houses<br>
          are the necessity of circumstances. As such they are made the best<br>
          of, and whatever discomforts they entail are passed off as unavoidable<br>
          and not thought of. A philosophical common sense is a great help in<br>
          living in the arctic regions, as elsewhere. If you are subjected to<br>
          miserable discomforts, or even if you suffer, it must be regarded as all<br>
          right and simply a part of the life, and like sailors, you must never<br>
          dwell too much on the dangers or suffering, lest others question your<br>
          courage.</p>

        <p>In camping one must be careful of the few belongings and
          camp tools, for anything left outside at night is sure to be covered over
          in the morning if it is blowing, and anything that has to be left out must
          be stuck up in the snow or packed in the sleds if you want to see it
          again. We had now been traveling so long that our camping and
          packing the sleds had been reduced to a system. There were four of
          us and each had his own part of the work to do. The doctor was the
          cook and looked out for the stove and the food. I attended to the
          sleds and the tent, fhe native woman was the doctor’s assistant and
          besides looked after our clothes, while her husband Nekowrah helped
          me and did the heavy work. On coming to our camping place,
          Nekowrah and I would get out the tent and pitch it. This done, the
          doctor would set up his stove, while Nekowrah went on a hunt for
          wood, and I would bank up the snow around the sides to keep the wind
          out and secure the hut generally. Then the sleds were unpacked and
          all our sleeping gear, food, and cooking utensils were passed in to
          Shucungunga, who arranged them inside. By the time the fire was
          started in the stove, the dogs were unharnessed, and the sleds put
          beyond their reach. This would all take from one-half to threequarters
          of an hour, and in that time the tent would be good and
          warm and we could go inside and change our clothes. The wet ones
          were passed over to Shucungunga for drying, who stretched a line
          along the ridgepole and hung up the clothes to catch all the warm air
          possible.
          It was not long before supper was ready, and it generally mattered
          little what it was, so long as there was enough, for by this time we
          were about like the dogs, hungry enough to eat anything that could
          be chewed. Usually the supper consisted of bacon and beans, followed
          by “slapjacks” (cakes made of flour and water and fried), and all the
          tea we could drink, generally not less than a quart.</p>

        <p>In the morning Nekowrah or the doctor would be
          up by 5 o’clock and have the fire started and the breakfast under way,
          which was not different from the supper—simply something to eat.</p>

        <p>Breakfast being over, the sleds were gotten out and packed, reserv¬
          ing the tent to the last, so as to be handy at night. The grub box, with
          a little food inside, and a camp kettle and axe were placed on the sled
          where they could easily be gotten at in case a stop was made during
          the day. The sleds were then lashed, the dogs caught and har¬
          nessed, and we were ready to start.</p>

        <p>It was impossible to see 10 yards ahead, and I
          knew it would be reckless to start off alone, for the others were far in
          advance by this time, and I might wander about all night, become ex¬
          hausted, and perhaps freeze.</p>

        <p>After getting in my bag seldom
          did I ever sleep cold, and less seldom do I remember being wakeful
          during the night.</p>

        <p id="text9">From Cape Prince of Wales on we had been treated to bright auroral<br>
          displays almost every night. They generally came out of a dark bank<br>
          that would form in the northern horizon just after dark, and stretch<br>
          in long shooting streamers that gradually worked over the heavens to<br>
          the opposite horizon, waving back and forth, so close to the earth as<br>
          to be seemingly within reach, and then as gradually receded and sub&mdash;<br>
          sided. Usually they came in extremely cold weather and seemed to<br>
          presage cold weather for the following day. I was particularly on the<br>
          watch to see the brilliant colors so often described, but was disap&mdash;<br>
          pointed; and, while they lit up the heavens and the snow-covered<br>
          earth, I could note only a faint orange and violet color in the displays,<br>
          and people who have lived in the country many years told me they<br>
          never showed more color than we saw, so I concluded that, on this coast<br>
          at least, they were seldom more than streaks of orange tinged light.<br>
          During the coldest days there were numerous sun-dogs, and, sailor&mdash;<br>
          like, when two and often three of these showed in the sky, I anticipated<br>
          bad and stormy weather, but it never came, and it seemed that good<br>
          weather instead of bad followed in these regions.</p>

        <p>During the night
          I awoke to find one foot feeling like a block of ice, and found that I
          had worked into a cramped position which had stopped the circulation
          and the rest of the night I spent kicking that foot to keep it from
          freezing.</p>

        <p>The thermometer registering —40°, we were not very comfortable in
          our tent without a fire, and long before morning Mikkel decided it
          was too cold to sleep, and turned out of his bag, and made a roaringfire
          of driftwood on the beach, of which there is great abundance all
          along this coast.</p>

        <p>After nightfall we kept our course by the stars, and the natives,
          who were tired out, claimed we would miss the village, wander a long
          way up Hotham Inlet, and lose ourselves till morning.</p>

        <p>we felt much better in the tent that night after a good
          supper</p>

          watch had to be kept both day and night. Last night three wolves got into the herd and killed one<br>
          deer before they were discovered and driven off.</p>

        <p class="text1-2">Feeding the dogs was always a trying and inter&mdash;<br>
          esting task. They are always hungry, and upon appearing among<br>
          them with an armful of dried fish, in their eagerness to get a stray<br>
          mouthful, they crowd around in one fighting, jumping mass, and<br>
          make it difficult for one to even keep his balance. After throwing<br>
          out a fish to each dog, it takes all hands with clubs to keep off the<br>
          larger fellows and see that the smaller and weaker ones are allowed<br>
          to keep and eat their share. Usually they are peaceful enough, but<br>
          when being fed they are like wild animals, and snarl and bite each<br>
          other, and keep up a continual fight until everything is eaten. When<br>
          the meal is finished and there is nothing more to eat in sight, they<br>
          will lie down quietly in the snow and go to sleep. They are tough<br>
          and need no protection. During the coldest weather and the most<br>
          violent blizzards, they will curl up on the snow anywhere and sleep,<br>
          and when the snow has drifted over them, get up, shake themselves,<br>
          and lie down again in the same place for another sleep.</p>



        <p>and after supper and a smoke it was time to feed the dogs. The
          frozen seal meat was first chopped into small pieces, and Nekowrah
          and myself, armed with clubs, would undertake to see that all the
          dogs fared alike. It was a task, for I know of nothing so ravenous as
          a hard-worked Eskimo dog, and with a pack of fifteen or twenty ani¬
          mals it took all of our time and attention to see that the larger dogs
          did not monopolize all the food. If a piece of meat was too large for
          a dog to swallow immediately, another dog would have it out of his
          mouth and a general fight ensue, and then a liberal use of the clubs
          would be necessary to produce harmony in the pack. Dogs should be
          fed once a day, and best at night, after they have rested a while from
          their work. It is bad to feed them much in the morning or to feed
          them during the day, as they become heavy and loggy, and do not
          work so well as on an empty stomach.</p>

        <p>On the morning of March 17 we found the dogs buried in the
          drift, with only their noses sticking out. They were all right, how¬
          ever, and anxious to be going.</p>

        <p class="text1-1">I afterwards learned that during this<br>
          blizzard Lopp was compelled to move his camp. How such things<br>
          are done at such times none can tell but those who do them, and too<br>
          often the experiences are so terrible that the desire is to forget about<br>
          them when they have passed. When we caught up with the deer herd<br>
          later, all the party showed the effects of their work this day, in the<br>
          masses of black skin on their faces and noses where they had been<br>
          frozen while shifting their camp. During this day the thermometer<br>
          registered—40° to—45°, which is unusually low with so much wind.</p>

        <p class="text1-2">March16.&mdash;Though the temperature moderated somewhat to-day,<br>
          the wind blew as hard as ever, and we could only remain where we<br>
          were until the blizzard had spent its force. We had been warned con&mdash;<br>
          cerning the blizzards on this coast, and I had heard many stories of<br>
          the terrible times of parties who had been caught in these storms.<br>
          One party I knew of had been storm-bound for forty-two days at a<br>
          place but a few miles from where we now were, and were compelled<br>
          to eat their dogs before the storm passed over.</p>

        <p>We thought our blizzards were about done with, but
          soon found that they were almost of daily occurrence and we must
          make the best of them, and the most of what time we could travel in
          between.</p>

        <p>the snow began to fly, blinding us so there was no use trying to
          face it, and we had to camp where we were. We had to dig a hole in
          the snow and build a barricade around it before we could pitch our
          tent in safety.</p>

        <p>We had our
          usual snowstorm at night and it lasted until the middle of the follow¬
          ing day,</p>
        <p>Our usual blizzard came up</p>

          was greatly relieved and overjoyed at this news; our plans were mov&mdash;<br>

          trip successfully.</p>

        <p class="text1-2">We were all grateful to Mr. Lopp and
          the “boys” for what they had done, and I can not speak too highly
          of the skill, courage, and persistent, untiring work they showed from
          the beginning to the end of that long journey.</p>

        <p>There came with Dr. Kettleson, to manage our train, Mikkel,
          a Laplander, who was counted a thoroughly experienced and capa¬

the officers must take charge in the name of the Government and
organize the community for mutual support and good order, appor¬

necessary (which it is hoped will have arrived) for food, to make all
hold out until August, 1898, when you will arrive in the Bear.</p>

        <p class="text1-2">We were so near our journey’s end now that we could afford to look
          back with a measure of satisfaction. On starting out it was hardly
          thought or contemplated that we could reach Point Barrow before
          April, and, although I set that limit myself and stuck to it, there were
          many times, when, considering the difficulties and dangers, I had mis¬
          givings as to our being able to arrive within the limited time. Fol¬
          lowing the windings of the coast, as we had come, we had traveled
          something in the neighborhood of 1,500 miles or more. We had
          lived on the country, as we were directed, and had drawn from it all
          our means of travel, except a part of our camp gear and the small
          store we brought from the ship. The movements of the reindeer
          herd had far exceeded our expectations and were due to the extraor
          dinary work of Mr. Lopp and liis “boys.” Our plans to overcome
          the many obstacles and difficulties had been carried out almost
          exactly as we had laid them down. Loss of life or serious accident,
          which were always imminent, had been averted by extreme care,
          and we were now within 15 miles of our destination and in good con¬
          dition and ready to take up the control of the situation at Point Barrow,
          as we had been directed.</p>

        <p>We started with 448 in all, including the 7 Lieutenant Bertholf
          brought to Kotzebue Sound, and we arrived at Point Barrow with 382.
          The difference represents what we had to kill for food for ourselves,
          and what were killed by overwork and by dogs and wolves, 32 in all;
          and the 34 which strayed off in a blizzard near Cape Kruzenstern,
          but were afterwards recovered and driven to Lieutenant Bertholf at
          Point Hope. Considering the hurried time, the unknown and untried
          regions, and all the dangers incident to such travel and work, I con¬
          sider the drive in everyway a marked success.</p>

        <p>In detailing the work of the expedition, I have not dwelt upon the
          personal part of the travel Avith any intention to magnify the dangers
          or trials, but simply to віюлѵ some of the difficulties we encountered,
          and which all people traveling in that country have to contend
          against. That we overcame them was due to the enthusiastic labor
          of all in the effort to carry out your orders; and to the help we
          received from those living in the country and from the natives.
          The help of the natives to us and to the people at Point Barrow is
          deserving of some substantial reward.

          Very respectfully, D. H. Jarvis,
          <em>First Lieutenant, R. C. S.,
            Commanding Overland Relief Expedition.</em>

          President, by the Chamber of Commerce and the people of San Fran&mdash;<br>

          the necessity for relief so urgent, that the President immediately<br>
          ordered an expedition to be fitted out.<br>
          Little hope was held out by those experienced in work in the Arctic<br>
          regions that anything could be accomplished by an expedition in the<br>
          winter season, but by the order of the President and under the direc&mdash;<br>
